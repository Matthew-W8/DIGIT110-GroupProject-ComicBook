            <li><h3>Matthew Wilpula</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Matthew was the team leader and contributed by setting up times to meet, doing the html and css, except where noted, and the xslt for converting our xml into readable code.
                Matthew was also responsible for the cbml for chapter 26.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Harry Bartolotti</h3><ul>
                <li>Harry contributed to our project by picking 'Jojo's Bizzare Adventure: Steel Ball Run', coming up with formmatting we should use in our cbml,
                    typed up chapter 25 in cbml, and
                did a fantastic job on the characters page.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><h3>Connor Carpenter</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Connor did the cbml for chapter 26.</li>

        <div class="goal"><h3>Our Goal:</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to encode chapter 25-27 of Jojo's Bizzare Adventure: Steel Ball Run focusing on characters and their dialogue.</p>
            <p>Our analysis <a href="#analysis">(linked here</a>, or below) is dedicated to how often characters speak outloud or in their head.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explain"><p>We decided on analyzing "Jojo's Bizzare Adventure: Steel Ball Run" because of Matthew and Harry's love for the series.</p>
        <p>Things went very smoothly at first, with each memeber easily taking an understanding to xml and cbml. However, Connor soon dropped the project, leaving Matthew and Harry with more than
        they could chew, but eventually the two finished their assigned chapters.</p>
        <p>Problems arose when it came to xslt however, but Matthew soon picked up and was able to output our HTML and analysis using it.</p>
        <p>Harry then created a characters page with a beautiful css.</p>
        <p>Throughout the entire project with struggled with what our "Big Picture" conclusion would be. We had thought about marking locations or music references
        but they were too spread out for us to be able to encode them in a timely manner. Thankfully during our presentation Dr. Beshero-Bondar gave us the idea to
        track how frequently characters speak compared to how frequently they think to themselves. So we did.</p></div>
        <div class="documentation"><h2>Documentation:</h2>
        <p>We used a variation of xml called CBML (Comic Book Markup Language) created by the TEI to markup the manga. The xml files can be on our
            <a href="https://github.com/Matthew-W8/DIGIT110-SteelBallRun">GitHub</a> as well as our xslt used to convert xml to readable html.</p>
            <p>We got our working copy of "Jojo's Bizzare Adventure: Steel Ball Run" from <a href="#">MangaDex</a>. All images featuring the manga were
            obtained from there as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="analysis">
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>Using xslt, we analzyed how often character spoke in their heads compared to outloud. Below are the results:</p>
