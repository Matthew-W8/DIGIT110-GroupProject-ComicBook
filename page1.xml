    TO SUMMARIZE A HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
    
    The 'telephone' that was invented by Alexander Graham Bell became a staple in 50,000 Amercian Households alone within four years.
    
    The 'steam locomotive' that crossed the North Amercian continent reached
    a top speed of 120km/hr, and an average speed of 88km/hr.
    
    And the public spectator sports frenzy, the Pro Baseball National League
    was born in 1876, and the first champion horse team was the "Chicago White Sox".
    The race horse "Domino" was the champion of the Kentucky Derby in 1891, and
    reigned undefeated as "Black Whirlwind".
    
    And in the first international Olympics that opened in Athens, Greece in 1896,
    each sport had "prize money" despite strict amateur regulations.
