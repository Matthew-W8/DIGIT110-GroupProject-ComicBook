                    <cbml:balloon type="description"> Name - "Pork Pie Hat Kid" ; Stand Name - Wired ; Pork Pie Hat's stand looks like a winch, which can wind up its wires with tremendous power. He seems to be able to lift about one horse. Through a plate with water, Pork Pie Hat can lower his hooks through a different dimension to catch his prey. If he uses a bait such as a feather or an insect, he can hook his prey from the bait itself. There are 2 wires.

                    <cbml:balloon type="description"> Name - Gyro Zeppeli ; Ability Name - Steel Ball No. 1, Steel Ball no. 2 ; By spinning the steel balls, Gyro can carve into rocks, as well as harden or numb the skin of living things. Gyro claims it to be a "technique", but it is not true that his power has gotten stronger since passing through the strange land of the "Devil's Palm"? The steel balls have throwing range of 20 to 30 meters.
                    </cbml:balloon>
                    <cbml:balloon type="description"> Name - Johnny Joestar ; Stand Name - Tusk ; Johnny can spin the nails on his hands and feet, and can cut with them and shoot them like bullets. It seems that the nails grow back, no matter how many are shot. The range of the nails is about 10 meters. He can also move around by the friction caused by the spin. When Johnny passed through the "Devil's Palm", the mummified left hand came into Johnny's hand. This was the cause of his stand ability. The guardian of the left arm appears in the form of that shown on the left. That's what it looked like to Johnny.
